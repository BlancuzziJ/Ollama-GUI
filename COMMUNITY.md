## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components

Understanding these components makes porting and contributing much easier:

#### **1. Ollama API Layer** (`core_methods.py`)

```python
# Clean abstraction over Ollama's REST API
class OllamaInterface:
    def list_models()
    def pull_model(name)
    def delete_model(name)
    def chat(model, messages)
    def get_model_info(name)
```

**Why this matters**: This layer can be ported to any language that can make HTTP requests. The interface is intentionally simple and mirrors Ollama's actual API.

#### **2. Security Layer** (`security.py`)

```python
# Comprehensive input validation and security
class SecurityValidator:
    def validate_model_name(name)
    def validate_user_input(text)
    def sanitize_output(text)
    def check_url_safety(url)
```

**Why this matters**: Security shouldn't be an afterthought. This provides patterns you can adapt to any language/framework.

#### **3. UI Components** (`main.py`)

- **Chat Interface**: Message display, input handling, conversation flow
- **Model Management**: List, install, delete, configure models
- **Settings Panel**: Configuration, preferences, advanced options
- **Status Display**: Connection status, operation progress, error messages

**Why this matters**: These are the building blocks any GUI framework needs. The separation makes it easy to swap out the UI layer.

#### **4. Configuration Management**

```json
{
  "ollama_host": "http://localhost:11434",
  "default_model": "llama2",
  "security_mode": "strict",
  "ui_theme": "dark"
}
```

**Why this matters**: Standardized configuration means compatibility between implementations.

## 🚀 Quick Start for Porters

### Step 1: Choose Your Target Platform

**Consider your audience:**

- **Web Developers**: JavaScript/TypeScript + React/Vue/Angular
- **Mobile Developers**: React Native, Flutter, or native
- **Enterprise Developers**: C#/.NET, Java, or Go
- **System Developers**: Rust, C++, or native platform tools

### Step 2: Map the Components

Start with the API layer - it's the easiest to port:

```javascript
// JavaScript example
class OllamaInterface {
  async listModels() {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/api/tags`);
    return response.json();
  }

  async pullModel(name) {
    return fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/api/pull`, {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({ name }),
    });
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Security

Adapt the security patterns to your language:

```csharp
// C# example
public class SecurityValidator
{
    public bool ValidateModelName(string name)
    {
        return Regex.IsMatch(name, @"^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9._-]*$");
    }

    public string SanitizeUserInput(string input)
    {
        return HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(input.Trim());
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Build the UI

Start simple - even a basic interface is valuable:

1. **Model List** - Show available models
2. **Chat Interface** - Send messages, display responses
3. **Basic Management** - Pull and delete models

### Step 5: Share Early

Don't wait for perfection! Share your work as soon as it's functional:

- Create a repository with clear README
- Document what works and what doesn't
- Ask for feedback and collaborators
- Cross-link with the main ShamaOllama project

## 🛠️ Development Resources

### Code Examples

**API Communication Pattern:**

```python
# Python (reference)
response = requests.post(f"{host}/api/chat",
    json={"model": model, "messages": messages})

# JavaScript equivalent
const response = await fetch(`${host}/api/chat`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
    body: JSON.stringify({model, messages})
});

# C# equivalent
var content = new StringContent(
    JsonSerializer.Serialize(new {model, messages}),
    Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
var response = await httpClient.PostAsync($"{host}/api/chat", content);
```

**Security Validation Pattern:**

```python
# Input validation example - adapt to your language
def validate_model_name(name):
    if not name or len(name) > 100:
        return False
    if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9._-]*$', name):
        return False
    if any(blocked in name.lower() for blocked in ['..', '/', '\\']):
        return False
    return True
```

### Testing Guidelines

**Essential Test Cases:**

1. **Connection Tests** - Handle Ollama offline/online states
2. **Model Operations** - List, pull, delete, info retrieval
3. **Chat Functionality** - Send messages, receive responses
4. **Security Validation** - Reject malicious inputs
5. **Error Handling** - Graceful failure recovery
6. **UI Responsiveness** - Handle long-running operations

### Documentation Standards

**Every port should include:**
