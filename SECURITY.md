## üîí Security Features

ShamaOllama implements comprehensive security measures to protect users:

### Input Validation

- **Message Length Validation**: User messages are validated for reasonable length limits
- **Model Name Validation**: Model names are validated to prevent injection attacks
- **URL Validation**: All URLs are validated before opening to prevent malicious redirects
- **File Path Validation**: File operations are restricted to safe directories

_Note: Content validation has been minimized to ensure maximum performance and user freedom. ShamaOllama acts as a fast bridge to Ollama, trusting Ollama's own security mechanisms for content handling._

### Data Protection

- **Secure Logging**: Security events are logged for monitoring and debugging
- **Safe File Operations**: All file operations are restricted to the user's `.shamollama` directory
- **Session Management**: Secure session tokens are generated for internal operations
- **Minimal Input Processing**: User inputs are passed directly to Ollama with minimal interference for maximum speed

_Note: ShamaOllama prioritizes performance and user freedom, delegating content security to Ollama's robust handling mechanisms._

### Network Security

- **URL Scheme Validation**: Only HTTP and HTTPS URLs are allowed
- **Domain Validation**: URLs are validated against allowed domain patterns
- **Connection Timeouts**: All network requests have appropriate timeouts
- **Error Handling**: Network errors are logged without exposing sensitive information

## üõ°Ô∏è Threat Protection

### Protected Against

- **Path Traversal**: File operations are restricted to safe directories
- **Malicious URLs**: Dangerous URLs are blocked before opening
- **Data Exfiltration**: File access is limited to the application directory
- **Network Vulnerabilities**: Secure API communication with proper error handling

_Note: Content-based protections (XSS, code injection) are handled by Ollama itself. ShamaOllama focuses on file system, network, and application-level security while maintaining maximum chat performance._
